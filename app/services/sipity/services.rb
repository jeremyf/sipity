module Sipity
  # Service objects are all the rage. Here is the junk drawer for your service
  # objects.
  #
  # This neighborhood of Sipity does not have an obvious home owners
  # association. That is to say, things are going to be a bit more organic in
  # their construction.
  #
  # You might find objects that fullfil a single purpose (i.e.DoiCreationRequestMetadataGatherer).
  # Or you may find the ever growing Repository object, with its fingers
  # reaching deep into the persistence layer concerns.
  #
  # Be mindful as you introduce objects. Make sure this area is groomed on
  # occassion. Organizing and sorting out where something best goes.

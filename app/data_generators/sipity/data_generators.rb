module Sipity
  # Sipity levereages a lot of data-driven configuration. This module is a place
  # to provide classes and infrastructure for bootstrapping the configuration
  # related data entries.
  #
  # ## Why Not Factories?
  #
  # Because of the ubiquitous FactoryGirl, I am avoiding the name of Factory.
  # In using the term DataScaffolds I hope to convey that these more closely
  # resemble a rails generator; In other words, use the data generators to
  # help bootstrap the application.
